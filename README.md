# 2-D Maze Game

### This is a simple game written in C++.

#### How to play
Players can use the arrow keys to navigate the maze.  
The game has start and exit buttons as well as a button to generate a new maze. 

#### Intention
I built this project in order to gain a better understanding of how openGL works  
and to gain some insight into how to make a simple interactive 2-D game.

I learned quite a bit about coding conventions and best practises when using opengl.  
I also learned more about makefiles as well as how to structure slightly larger projects.   

No doubt there are various improvements that could be made.

#### Libraries used:
+ glad &emsp;&emsp;&ensp; - extension loader for gpu driver functions
+ GLFW &emsp;&ensp; - for window creation and to handle user input
+ stb image &nbsp;- to help load images
+ GLM &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; - for vector and matrix operations

#### How to install and run
I only ran the program on Ubuntu 22.04  
Probably should try putting it in a docker container.
